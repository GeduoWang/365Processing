365 Processing
=============

This 365 project is my way of learning how to code by challenging myself to make one animation a day in Processing. 

<i>The Nature of Code</i> by Danielf Shiffman has been my primary source for learning along with other supplementary blogs and books. With Shiffman's project, there are so many different ways you can learn from himâ€“there's a book, website and my favourite, videos. Also, you can acquire all of his code examples though GitHub.
