365 Processing
=============

A 365 project where each day I make one animation in Processing. I've been working through Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman along with a ton of supplementary resources. 

I would say I'm a beginner to coding and this project was a way for me to learn a programming language. Since I'm formally trained in graphic design, I thought Processing would be a good start. 

As a disclaimer, I know my code probably has some issues and isn't properly commented, but I plan on trying to get better as the year goes on.
